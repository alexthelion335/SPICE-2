SPICE 2 Hacked for Linux

Changes from the upstream version (original versions of files were renamed
to have suffix .original):

* Declarations were added to spice.f for all variables used to store time
  values, to eliminate compile errors.

* Use of VAX assembly language in unix.c was disabled.

* Code was added to grab the argc/argv values during C runtime startup.

The binary here was built on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit; it may or may not run
on other distros. To rebuild from source:

1. Make sure you have the gfortran package installed (i.e. "apt-get install
   gfortran").

2. Run the build script in this directory (i.e. "./build").

Note: I haven't tested that it actually produces correct results; I haven't
used SPICE in over 30 years and I'm not about to re-learn it now. But the
program loads, and errors out with a "INPUT DECK (FILE) CONTAINS NO DATA"
error if you hit ^D, which indicates that it is sitting there waiting for a
simulation file on standard input.
