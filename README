Build Instructions for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit:

1. Make sure you have the gfortran package installed (i.e. "apt-get install
   gfortran").

2. Run the build script in this directory (i.e. "./build").

   SPICE-2 now compiles and runs without error on AMD64 systems thanks to Tom Russo. To be 
   completely honest, I had forgotten this repo exists until I got an email notification about
   the pull request. In the long term, making this arch agnostic is a goal. In the near future,
   I will work on releasing some prebuilt packages and be doing some testing on various distros.

   Right now, SPICE-2 compiles thanks to the hard work of Mike Uchima. Upon running a simulation, 
   it throws a segmentation fault and crashes. I'm going to be focusing my time on getting SPICE to 
   do a clean compile in hope of the seg fault being fixed by that.
